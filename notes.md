### GAME FEATURES TO WORK ON

- [x] figure out the tech / parenting system
- [x] get some workers to carry some blocks to the pyramid & start stacking them!
 - [x] we can reverse engineer our pyramid draw algorithm to instead get the block placement required
- [~] add the other technology objects
- [ ] Merge the pyramid geometry after layer finish. Need this to maintain 60fps as game progresses
- [ ] work on interface to actually control the units, buy more, upgrade, etc

### ENHANCEMENTS

- [x] orbit controls instead of automatic spinning would be nice
- [ ] fix the sand, maybe add some sand particles / dust, clouds could be cool, fog
- [x] More detailed human model
- [ ] basic animations
- [ ] sled rope

### QUESTIONS
- ~~What is the win state?~~
- Leaderboard? What is the score to track, time spent?
 - Probably wont have time for this!


----

#### Win state
- All the units circle around the pyramid with torches
- Time goes to night (look at first commit & reuse some of that code)
